## Getting Started

Archer currently supports **Unix-based systems** (macOS, Linux, FreeBSD). Make sure you have the required dependencies installed before proceeding.

First, install docker and docker-compose with your package manager of choice, eg.:
```pacman -S docker docker-compose```

Then, you'll want to edit your .env.example and save it as .env (Remove the .example!) with a text editor of choice (VSCode, Nano, NVim, etc.)

And finally, to start your bot use
```sudo docker-compose up --build```
If you do not want to use sudo you can also add your user to the docker group and run
```docker-compose up --build```

Enjoy!
